# HPC Raw Data

WARNING: The raw data in this folder requires decompression in order to be used by the 
processing scripts. Decompression will result in files of size of up to 100GB, so it is
recommended that each file within the raw data set is processed individually and that the
decompressed files are deleted between each processing step.


Some of raw data for this project (specifically, the data for the ensembles involving the 50x50
grid for ReCom) is a bit too large to be stored on GitHub and is therefore only
available upon request. However, for any raw data that is not stored here, there is available
processed data in the corresponding `hpc_processed_data` subdirectory. If you would like access
to the original raw data lease contact us at `code[at]mggg[dot]org` for more information.

Note that all of the raw data is perfectly reproducible using the scripts in the `slurm_scripts`
folder.
