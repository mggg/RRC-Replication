# Example Files

This is a folder containing smaller examples using a 5x5 grid. We decided to include this
directory in order to make it easier to audit our entire process without the need for 
an HPC. 

## Quick notes

If you are running the scripts in this directory on a Macintosh system, it is likely that
you will need to install `coreutils` in addition to doing all of the setup listed in
the main README file for this repository. If you have brew installed, then installing 
the `coreutils` package is as simple as 

```console
brew install coreutils
```
